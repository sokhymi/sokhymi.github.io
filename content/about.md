With more than 4 years of experience as a GIS Developer and Data Engineer, I have experience working with numerous different technologies, ranging from GIS-related tools, including Python, SQL, ArcGIS and QGIS (and their APIs for Python), to Azure Data Factory, Apache Spark and Apache Kafka, with a strong fundamental understanding of computing and machine learning workflows.

Currently, I am a Master's student at University of Salzburg as part of the Erasmus Mundus programme 'Copernicus Digital Earth', specializing in data science for geospatial applications.
